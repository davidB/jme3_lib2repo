A project to download (http) and install in local maven repository jme3 (java monkey engine 3.0) and some jme3 contributions (like lemur).

Then the libs can be used by project using maven, gradle, ivy, sbt, ... to manage dependencies.

Contributions (PR) are  welcomes (it's my first gradle project).
